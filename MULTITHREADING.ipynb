    "ANS--Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently\n",
    "within the same process. A thread is a lightweight subprocess that can execute independently, sharing the \n",
    "same resources as other threads within the process. Python's multithreading allows you to perform concurrent\n",
    "tasks efficiently and take advantage of multi-core processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to achieve concurrent execution and improve performance in certain scenarios. It allows \n",
    "a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making better use of available resources and reducing the\n",
    "overall execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module is used to handle threads. It provides classes and functions to create and manage threads\n",
    "within a Python program. The threading module allows you to start, stop, and synchronize threads, and it also\n",
